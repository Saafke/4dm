# Documentation

We provide separate documentation for the capturing system and for the reconstruction software.
To facilitate research and development, these two systems can be executed independently from each other.
The reconstruction software can be executed and tested with the data captured for this [publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07883).

## Installation and usage capturing system

To install the three required component, follow the specific instructions [MLAPI](installation/MLAPI.md) [Data manager](installation/Data_Manager.md) and the [Android application](installation/Android_application.md)

The start of Data Manager and MLAPI is describe inside the installation process, and after this no further actions are required. 
Instead [here](usage/Android_application.md) you can find a guide on how to use the Android application.

## Installation and usage reconstruction software

The specific documentation for 3D pose and volumetric reconstruction can be found [here](https://github.com/mbortolon97/4dm/tree/main/reconstruction_sw).
