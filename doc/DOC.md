# Documentation

We provide separate documentation for the capturing system and for the reconstruction software.
To facilitate research and development, these two systems can be executed independently from each other.
The reconstruction software can be executed and tested with the data captured for this [publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07883).

## Installation and usage capturing system

The capturing systems includes three modules and their respective documentation is listed below.

- [app](installation/Android_application.md)
- [mlapi-server](installation/MLAPI.md)
- [data-manager](installation/Data_Manager.md)

## Installation and usage reconstruction software

The specific documentation for 3D pose and volumetric reconstruction can be found in
- [reconstruction_sw](https://github.com/mbortolon97/4dm/tree/main/reconstruction_sw).
